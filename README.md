# Strategic Move AI 🎯

This project is an **AI-powered strategy board game** developed in **C language**.  
The player and the computer compete on a 7x7 grid, each trying to outmaneuver the other by strategically moving their pieces.  
The computer’s decisions are guided by the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** and a custom **heuristic evaluation** function.
